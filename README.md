This project builds an AI agent using PyTorch and Pygame to conquer the classic Snake game. The agent leverages reinforcement learning to navigate the grid, optimize its actions, and maximize its score. Through training and adaptation, it learns patterns, makes strategic decisions, and improves its gameplay, showcasing the power of Python, PyTorch, and reinforcement learning in dynamic environments.
